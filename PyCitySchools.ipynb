    "# STUDY FINDINGS\n",
    "The findings of the initial analysis of 15 different High Schools has been quite revealing.  The overall passing rate the aggregate of reading and math is of 80.4 percent, with a passing rate of 85.8 percent in reading and 75.0 percent for math.  \n",
    "Taking a more in-depth look we saw the charter schools rise to the top, with the highest scores in math and reading, along with the highest passing rate overall.  The top 5 performing schools overall passing rate was higher than 95 percent, all of which were Charter schools.  On the contrary the lowest performing schools scored a below 74 percent overall passing rate, all of which were District schools.\n",
    "Looking at average performance across all 4 years of high school (9th to 12th) of both reading and math, it is notable to point out the average across the grades and schools remained constant with marginal fluctuation.  This indicates that the studentsâ€™ mean performance across their high school career did not show improvement or decline across grades.  It could be inferred that an above average performing student in 9th grade, will maintain that across his/her entire high school trajectory and vice versa.   \n",
    "Analyzing the spending ranges per student, an inverse relationship between per student budget and overall passing rate was observed.   Lowest budget per student of $581 saw the highest overall passing rate of 95.0 percent. \n",
    "All margins of analysis have favored the notion of Charter schools outperforming District schools by significant percentage points. However, this analysis is not binding nor definitive.  \n",
    "Charter schools have more autonomy in regard to having selective methods when it comes to admitting students.  Affluent parents also tend to invest more on tutors and extra-curricular means to provide their children a more competitive edge as they are preparing for a future college career.  District schools do not have those discriminative methods and at times are not fully funded, generating larger student to teacher ratio.  \n",
    "The exploratory analysis done has yielded a great starting point for a more in-depth more descriptive analysis.  \n"
